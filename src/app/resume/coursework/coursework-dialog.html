    <h3>Object-Oriented Software Development</h3>
    <p>In this course students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming using Java. Standard design
        notations from
        UML are used to describe software designs. Students write Java programs that use simple data structures, such as
        lists,
        queues and stacks. Fundamental time and space analyses of traditional computing problems are practiced. Students
        also
        learn how to develop software that avoids security vulnerabilities and work in small teams to construct a simple
        network
        application.</p>

    <h3>Data Structures</h3>
    <p>This is a course on standard data structures, including sorting and searching and using the Java language. The
        topics
        include: stages of software development; testing; UML diagrams; elementary data structures (lists, stacks,
        queues, and
        maps); use of elementary data structures in application frameworks; searching; sorting; and introduction to
        asymptotic
        complexity analysis.</p>

    <h3>Discrete Structures</h3>
    <p>The aim of this course is to integrate knowledge of basic mathematics with the problems involving specification,
        design,
        and computation. By the end of the course, the student should be able to: use sets, functions, lists, and
        relations in
        the specification and design of problems; use properties of arithmetic, modular arithmetic (sum, product,
        exponentiation), prime numbers, greatest common divisor, factoring, Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem; use binary,
        decimal, and
        base-b notation systems and translation methods; use induction to design and verify recursive programs; and
        implement in
        Scheme all algorithms considered during the course.</p>

    <h3>Individual Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>In this course students learn to practice a disciplined engineering process for developing software. Individual
        skills
        and practices, such as effort estimation and unit testing, are mastered so that students can become successful
        members
        of software engineering teams. Best practices in software engineering are followed, including the use of simple
        design
        patterns with well-known properties. Students work in small teams to construct a simple web service using the
        industry
        standard Ruby programming language, Rails framework and MySQL database technology.</p>

    <h3>Software Requirements Analysis and Engineering</h3>
    <p>Requirements Acquisition is one of the least understood and hardest phases in the development of software
        products,
        especially because requirements are often unclear in the minds of many or most stakeholders. This course deals
        with the
        identification of stakeholders, the elicitation and verification of requirements from them, and translation into
        detailed requirements for a new or to-be-extended software product. It deals further with the analysis and
        modeling of
        requirements, the first steps in the direction of software design. The quality assurance aspects of the software
        requirements phase of the software development process is studied. Also an introduction to several formal
        methods for
        requirements specification is presented.</p>

    <!-- <h3>Circuits and Systems</h3>

    <p>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular
        combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated
        best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build
        applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p> -->

    <h3>Calculus I &amp; II / Differential Equations</h3>

    <p>Limits, the derivatives of functions of one variable, differentiation rules, applications of the derivative,
        integration, integrals.</p>

    <p>Ordinary differential equations of first and second order, homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations; improper
        integrals, Laplace transforms; review of infinite series, series solutions of ordinary differential equations
        near an
        ordinary point; boundary-value problems; orthogonal functions; Fourier series; separation of variables for
        partial
        differential equations.</p>
